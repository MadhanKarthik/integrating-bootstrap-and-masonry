=================================

Responsive example integrating Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery Masonry.

In this example I created an example of minimalistic layout for a blog/portfolio using Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery Masonry.

The number of columns is automatically calculated from the container using a proportioned width. 
The width is modified using media queries in order to have a better result in smaller screens.
